## QR-CODE PROJECT
This is a QR code task by frontend Mentor. It is designed  to enable the user scan the QR code which takes the user to the frontendmentor website. 
This project is designed with HTML and tailwindcss and is responsive to an extent.
This is the link to the hosted project online [https://sprightly-cobbler-6b8b88.netlify.app/]
Feel free to leave suggestions on how to improve my code and my readme file too as this is my first one.
Thank Youuuuuuuu.
